# Bootstrap-fall2023

A demonstration of a simple Bootstrap-based website created for the "Server-Side Web Development (CPSC4125)" course, Assignment 1, Fall 2023.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary aim was to explore the features and capabilities of Bootstrap, focusing on integrating various components like Navbar, Card, Buttons, and Modal. The website serves as a playground to display these elements in action.

## ✅ Requirements & Implementation

- **Bootstrap Integration:** Adopted the Bootstrap framework for styling and components.
- **Starter Template:** Used the official Bootstrap starter template.
- **GitHub:** The HTML document is uploaded on GitHub.
- **Navbar:** Implemented at the top for navigation.
- **Card:** Showcased in the features section.
- **Buttons:** Located within the hero and features sections. The hero section buttons direct to Bootstrap's official documentation.
- **Modal:** Activated by the "Just for show" button in the navbar.

## 📌 Note

- The "Just for show" button in the navbar triggers the modal.
- Buttons in the features section are placeholders and don't perform any operations.
- The footer copyright link directs to my personal website.
